The inclusive top-quark pair production is determined at four centre-of-mass energies at Tevatron and LHC with experimental uncertainties that are close to the uncertainties in theoretical calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. Several differential measurements are performed and compared to simulation. Production of single top quarks is studied in the three different production channels. Top-quark pair production with neutral and charged vector bosons has been observed by the LHC experiments. Finally, production of additional heavy flavour quark pairs ($b\\bar{b}$, $t\\bar{t}$) is studied or searched for."
